# task2-RedWineQuality
This repository contains the second task completed under the TECHNOHACKS EDU TECH Internship in the domain of Machine Learning.

This dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on its quality. The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Our task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.

It's a simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.
